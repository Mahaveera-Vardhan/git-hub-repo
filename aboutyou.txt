hi darling!

how are you doing?

you big fool.

don't you remember me. we were good friends back in our schooling. I don't see any excitement in your face.
Did you forget everything?

its not the good things people remember, they like to remember only the bad things.


when you don't accept your mistake, it'd become a sin after your death.


what do I do? curse my friend?
